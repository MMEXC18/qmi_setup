* Overview
  This is a simple shellscript to make the internet connection with your
  QMI (Qualcomm MSM Interface) supported wwan device like Sierra Wireless Inc. Gobi 3000.
  QMI supported devices are listed in the source of Linux kernel
  (check drivers/net/usb/qmi_wwan.c with your device id).
  These devices are also listed at [[http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/ModemManager/SupportedDevices/]]
  but not the all devices there.

  Type following command to start, stop and restart the internet connection,
  and check your device status.

* Tested environment
  - ThinkPad X220 (4286-CTO)
  - Gentoo/Linux, Linux Kernel 3.9.6
  - Sierra Wireless, Inc. Gobi 3000 wireless wan module (FRU 60Y3257)
    I recommend to check if your wwan module works fine
    for your mobile broadband provider with Windows
    especially if you imported the device from other country.
    You may have to initialize your device for your region.
  - NTT Docomo UIM card (Xi LTE SIM)

* Requirements
  - You have to prepare the kernel modules
    - qmi_wwan (CONFIG_USB_NET_QMI_WWAN)
    - qcserial (CONFIG_USB_SERIAL_QUALCOMM)
  - QMI commands
    *qmicli* and *qmi-network* cmmand are required. Install them.
  - APN settings
    APN settings are written to /etc/qmi-network.conf.
    In my environment, I put only a line.
    : % cat /etc/qmi-network.conf
    : APN=mopera.net
